Isolation is a turn-based strategy board game in which two players take it in turns to trap their opponent on an 8x8 chessboard. In the end, the players can no longer move, which means they are isolated. The pieces can move up and down, left and right and diagonally as many squares as desired. However, each player can only move the pieces under certain conditions (see also Fig. 1):

The rules of the game are as follows...

- Players cannot place their piece on a square that has already been visited (both squares that they have already visited themselves and squares that their opponent has visited), 
- Players cannot cross squares they have already visited, 
- Players cannot jump over the opponent's piece. 

The first player with no remaining legal moves loses and the opponent is declared the winner.
